# How to start contributing

All breathecode's maintainers are always making a great effort to create and document all the projects issues so that anyone can contribute without hesitance.

[These are all the contributions BreatheCode is looking for right now](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Abreatheco-de+label%3A%22help+wanted%22&type=Issues). All contributions are documented as [github issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) and issues tagged with any of these possible tags:

| Tag name          | Description |
| ----              | -------     |
| `first-timers-only` | Well documented issues for anyone that has not contributed before |
| `help-wanted`       | It means it will not be resolved by any formal member of the project, its an invitation for outsiders to contribute |
| `4geeks-student`    | This tag is used to welcome 4Geeks Academy students to the issue |
| `bc-writer`        | It means that the issue is for writing/fixing specs or documentation (no need of coding skills), [here is more info about the bc-writter tag](https://github.com/breatheco-de/main-documentation/blob/master/Contribution_Manuals/BreatheCode_Writer.md) |
| `bc-coder`          | you need coding skills to resolve the issue, [here is more info about the bc-coder tag](https://github.com/breatheco-de/main-documentation/blob/master/Contribution_Manuals/coder/BreatheCode_Coder.md) |
| `bc-inspector`      | it means they are very open for people testing the project/app/library and giving feedback, [here is more info about the bc-inspector tag](https://github.com/breatheco-de/main-documentation/blob/master/Contribution_Manuals/inspector/BreatheCode_Inspector.md) |

These additional tags are not used inside the breathecode community but are very popular open source, look for them if you would like to contribute somwhere else.

| Tag name          | Description |
| ----              | -------     |
| up-for-grabs | It's basically saying "anyone is welcomed" |
