# How o start contributing

All breathecode's mantainers are always making a great effort to create and document all the projects issues so that anyone can contribute without hessitance.

All contributions are documented as [github issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) and issues tagged with any of these possible tags:

| Tag name          | Description |
| ----              | -------     |
| first-timers-only | Well documented issues for anyone that has not contributed before |
| help-wanted       | It means it will not be resolved by any formal member of the project, its an invitation for outsiders to contribute |
| 4geeks-student    | This tag is used to welcome 4Geeks Academy students to the issue |
| bc-writter        | It means that the issue is for writting/fixing specs or documentation (no need of coding skills) |
| bc-coder          | you need coding skills to resolve the issue |
| bc-inspector      | it means they are very open for people testing the project/app/library and giving feedback |

These additional tags are not used inside the breathecode community but are very popular open source, look for them if you would like to contribute somwhere else.

| Tag name          | Description |
| ----              | -------     |
| up-for-grabs | It's basically saying "anyone is welcomed" |
