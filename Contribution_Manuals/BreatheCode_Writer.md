# Contributing as a BreatheCode Writer

Hi! :smile: Thanks for helping us to conceptualize and explain all BreatheCode projects to the community. If you feel that there is a gap in our documentation, you can participate and contribute to improving the project. Keep in mind that it is not a compilation of rules but a guide for submitting any suggestion and make sure the community understand your information and find related issues/ideas. Remember, even if you’re not the developer type, contributing to the documentation is still of enormous value.

## What kind of contributions do we expect as a BreatheCode Writer?

- **Creating new documentation** as projects descriptions, wikis, README files, technical documentation, or release notes to describe changes.
- **Updating documentation**: submit a whole update document (to change it, and then resubmit the entire document), or make partial updates (to relink, add further and latest information to previous documentation) by fixing broken links and spelling/grammatical errors and documenting a change to an existing file/contribution.
- **Enhancing documentation**: Put yourself in the readers' place. Contribute to creating a more easy-reading document. Ideally, readers should be able to grasp the overall structure and quickly find what they want. Think of graphic design as a delivery system for ideas (add images, charts, tables... where it is precise).

### BreatheCode Writer Documentation Styleguide

- **Use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)** for creating a clean and organized document. Also, you can check out how [writing on GitHub](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/). It is sometimes best to practice building a markdown file in an offline program before submitting your contribution.
-   **Use a clear and descriptive title**  to  identify your contribution/issue.
-   **Provide full and clear descriptions**:
	- Communicate in specifics and concrete terms, rather than generalities and abstractions. 
	- Beware of ambiguities.
	- Be concrete, use word-pictures, avoid abstract words. 
	- Use active instead of passive words.
	- Use logical order (general to especific).
-   **Include a section for credits** (if it applies) to highlight and link to the authors of the information it will contain.
-   **Enhance the content** Include images, .gif screen files, etc.  
**NOTES**:
If a change addresses an issue, include a line: `Fixes #<issue number>`.
