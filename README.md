<h1 align="center"> Welcome to BreatheCode </h1>

Hello, my name is :blush: [Alejandro Sanchez](https://alesanchezr.com) I'm one of the founders of BreatheCode, thank you for taking the time to read this!  :smile:

If you are curios about breathecode this is our mission:

> Use technology to **Accelerate the way junior developers learn and evolve**.

### We can acomplish that by coding the following types of projects:
- **Tools**: Stuff you can download and use to learn how to build software faster.
- **Libraries**: Libraries targeted to make coding simpler.
- **Apps**: We have published [https://breatheco.de/](https://breatheco.de/) focused on e-learning and blended learning, we expect to release mobile apps eventually as well.

> Using one of our projects (The [Breathecode CLI](https://github.com/breatheco-de/breathecode-cli)) we where able to include a set of [recommended boilerplates](https://github.com/breatheco-de/breathecode-cli/blob/master/boilerplates.json) to get started in different technologies with just a few steps.

If you want to learn more about our current projects and developments look at the end of the document.

## Are you here to contribute?

Great! You can contribute to BreatheCode in 3 different ways:
- **Coding**: Join the development of any particular project, the majority of our repositories are being actively maintain and with new versions on the pipeline. Read this [if you want to become a **BreatheCode Coder**](#).
- **Writing**: Help us explain everything to the community: What projects are available? how do they work? how to use them? Here is a more detailed guide you should read if you want to [become a **BreatheCode Writer**](#).
- **Report Bugs**: Report issues you find on the application or any improvements you would like. Here is how to report a bug or request a new feature on any of **BreatheCode projects**.

## Our current projects

These are the 3 types of projects in which the BreatheCode is divided:

### 1. Tools
In real life you use a lot of tools to code, like: Git, NPM, etc. We have proposed 2 additional tools for junior developers:

 | Project 		| Description | Technologies |
 | ---------- 	| -------------- | ---------------- |
 | [C9 Plugin](https://github.com/breatheco-de/c9-plugin) | Cloud 9 is a great IDE for junior developers because it allow you to work with very few configurations no an isolated machine. We have created a plugin to enhance the Cloud 9 coding IDE and integrated with all the other BreatheCode projects. | Node.js, Bash, JSON |
| [BreatheCode CLI](https://github.com/breatheco-de/breathecode-cli) | Command Line interface to connect with lots of useful stuff like access to boilerplates, exercises, builders, etc. | Node.js Bash, JSON |

### 2. Libraries:
Very focused libraries to resolve recurring issues during developments.

| Project 		| Description | Technologies |
| ---------- 	| -------------- | ---------------- |
|[React Session](https://github.com/breatheco-de/react-session) | Allows persistent sessions in react, compatible with react router. | React.js |
| [React Notifier](https://github.com/breatheco-de/react-notifier) | Notification library for React Applications. | React.js |
| [React Flux Dash](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-flux-dash) | Flux implementation for React.js | React.js |

### 3. Applications:

| Project 		| Description | Technologies |
| ---------- 	| -------------- | ---------------- |
| [CMS](https://github.com/breatheco-de/desktop-client) | This is were most of the community content is being published: Lessons, Error Explanations and "How to's". | Gatsby.js, CSS, React.js, Markdown, GIT |
| [Student Web Client](https://github.com/breatheco-de/desktop-client) | BreatheCode's main website for displaying the courses. | React.js, CSS, Sass, HTML |
| [Teacher Web Client](https://github.com/breatheco-de/teacher-client) | Teachers are able to manage the pace of their cohorts, review students deliverables, etc. | React.js, CSS, Sass, HTML |
 | [Admin Web Client](https://github.com/breatheco-de/admin-client) | Manage BreathCode students, teachers, etc. | React.js, CSS, Sass, HTML |
| [Assets API](https://assets.breatheco.de) | Amazing resources for students (infographics, lessons, cheat-sheets, mock api's, etc). | PHP, Markdown, SlimPHP, SQLite, MySQL, Static Files, REST |
